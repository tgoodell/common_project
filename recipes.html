                <li>Before the eggs are fully done, add the frozen vegetables. Add fresh vegetables when required so they are fully cooked by the end. </li>
                <li>(Optional) Add the additional protein when required so they are fully cooked by the end.</li>
                <li>Once the rice is done, add it to the pan. Poor your desired amount of Soy Sauce. Stir well. </li>
                <li>(Optional) After that, add your desired amount of additional sauce. Stir well.</li>
                <li>Let the fried rice cook until it is no longer visibly oily and the dish is nice and hot, with the vegetables fully cooked. </li>
                <li>Plate the fried rice. Enjoy! </li>
